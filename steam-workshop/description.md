Ever wanted to go over 9999 naval capacity?
- Then I've got just the treat for you!

[b]This mod removes the limit on produced naval capacity.[/b]

Your empire has to produce more than the vanilla limit of 9999 naval capacity (using Anchorages, Soldiers or Duelists) for this mod to provide any benefit!

[h1]Details[/h1]
This is done by setting NAVAL_CAPACITY_MAX from 9999 to 199999 in the NGameplay definitions.

The mod is compatible with everything.

It does not require starting a new game to work (and can be removed at any time).

New updates will probably never require an update to this mod, as the one thing it touches hasn't been changed by Paradox, ever.
Therefore the mod has been tagged to accept any past and future game versions.

Still, if you notice it stopped working, let me know.
